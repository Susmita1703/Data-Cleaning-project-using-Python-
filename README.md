# Data-Cleaning-using-Python

## Objective 🎯
The objective of this project is to transform a dataset with dirty and inconsistent data into a clean, reliable, and well-structured format suitable for analysis.  
The data cleaning process aims to achieve the following goals:  

- Identify and correct errors and inconsistencies.
- Handle missing or incomplete data appropriately.
- Standardize formats and values across the dataset.
- Ensure the data meets quality standards, making it ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Dataset summary 🗂️
 The data files are organized into four tables which includes information about patient details, medicines used to treat patients, problems/conditions of the patients, and reactions of  medications in the patients. These tables are currently unstructured and contain a significant amount of dirty data,which includes inconsistencies, errors, and missing values. The goal is to convert this data into an usable and clean format.

 **Details of each column in the files, providing comprehensive information about the data, are given below.**

###  Dirty Data Files 🗑️
Here are the four dirty data files of this project that needs to be cleaned:   
[File 1]   
[File 2]   
[file 3]   
[file 4]  

After observing the four files, I have concluded that it would be better to combine them and create two tables to complete the full cleaning process and prepare the data for analysis.  
### cleaned data files ✨  
The link of following cleaned data files are given below  
[file 1]  
[file 2]  

### The file given below includes all the steps that I have used to clean the data using python

## Conclusion 📌

**I have successfully cleaned the data, fixing errors and making sure everything is consistent. Duplicates were removed, missing values were addressed, and data types were corrected. Now, the dataset is clean, well-organized, and ready for further analysis.**
